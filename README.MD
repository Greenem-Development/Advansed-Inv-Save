# Advansed Inv Save
A minecraft plugin, adds commands for saving and loading your inventory. Can be used as a safety plugin in case of some bug occuring (totaly not talking about my Autorization plugin) or as a way of returning your items back if you really want to play this way...  
There are also console commands for giving players the permission to load the saved inventory. (There is no need to limit saving it)  
And there is a config.
