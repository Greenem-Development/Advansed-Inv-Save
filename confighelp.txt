This is description for main config file of the minecraft plugin "AdvansedInvSave"

The config lines should look like this:
   
   something: false
   other-thing: 1000
   (... And so on)

Available settings:

   log-catched-errors
   # Print errors and so on to console. Default: false
   
   enable-inv-menu
   # Enables /inv command which can show gui of this plugin. If you really don't want it to exist, you can disable it here. Default: true
   
   enable-local-storage
   # Allows players to open the local storage in gui (not really recommended for usual survival). Default: false
   
   enable-shared-storage
   # Allows players to open the shared storage in gui (same, but files are in different folder and this can be synchronized beetween servers. Useful for building, for example) Default: false
   
   shared-storage-path
   # To make shared storage work, enter the path for the folder for storing shared folders there. Default: null
   
   enable-whole-inventories
   # Allows players to open "Whole inventories" in gui. Still in development, but later it will be able to save entire inventories and do some menagement. Default: false
   
   enable-wardrobe
   # Allows players to open the wardrobe in gui (To save armor sets there. Still in development, but a bit closer to working state). Default: false
   
   enable-single-items
   # Allows players to open "Items" in gui (To save individual items there with enchantments and etc. Btw, it works!). Default: false

NOTE: Players CANNOT get any items from the gui and commands if they are not given the permission from console ("/permsinvadd" to give, "/permsinvremove" to remove, "/[later]" to give for using only once)
Btw, if you want to know, what the gui can do, just enable it (and other gui parts) for some time to check (and give youself the permission).

Tip: to reset a line in config (not this file) just delete it and type "/reloadadvinvsaveconfig" in chat or reload the entire plugin ("/reload" or "/reload confirm")
